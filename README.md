# Diabetes-Readmission-prediction

Predictive model to fit the relationship between the measurement of HbA1c and readmission of diabetes patients while controlling for covariates such as demographics, severity and type of the disease, and type of admission.
Domain: Healthcare Analytics
Build predictive model that can predict the readmission of diabetic patients with reasonable accuracy based on the HbA1c measure, race, gender, age, diagnosis, insulin and glucose serum levels, facility type, no. of diagnosis/procedures/medications, type of admission and time in facility. Also the aim of the model is to establish the importance of HbA1c measurement for such prediction.
Skills and Tools
Logistic Regression, Decision trees.


We were able to build predictive model that can predict readmission of diabetic patients with reasonable accuracy(more than 80%). Also we were able to establish that HbA1c measure has a significant bearing on the outcome of hospitalized patients. We were able to establish that 44% of the times HbA1c is not measured and when such encounters are also included in prediction then accuracy is only 65%. Such a model can be helpful for reducing the no. of readmissions by predicting them upfront and for deploying more appropriates measures in such encounters. Also recommendations can be made to providers for making the HbA1c test mandatory for diabetes encounters and based on the results the reluctance of providers to change medications would come down which overall would help cutting down the readmissions.
